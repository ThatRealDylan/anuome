# AnuomeSDK - Publishing
When your finally done with your package, you are now able to Publish Your OWN Package to the offical AnuomeSDK Repository for everybody to download, this is a proccess and you can either be denied or accepted. yes i am dumb and do not know how many things work, sorry, thats just me, Your package must follow these guidelines.

### Guidelines
(WIP, Project Guidelines will be added later.)

### publishing part
(This will not work right now since the project is still WIP, please wait until a stable release of 1.0 or 1.1 or idk)
First, Go Fork the repo

### (if you for some reason don't see it/don't know, but images give clarity or whatever its called)
Once done, put your package in the packages folder ('/packages' in main branch)

(why did i put so many images)

Finally, go back to the original repo (mine) and create a pull request comparing both your repo and my repo, remember to title it something like 'new package' or something like that.
Example:

<img width="1222" height="193" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ec4fc19-db67-4fda-a428-947b81ad0aa2" />

and finally... **(again)** you just got to wait for me, **if i ever get out of my cave or something**
or you could just send me a download link to the .anuo file instead of doing this

If i ever see your pull request, i will respond with a generic message and now its time for the reviewing phase.

## Review
When I get your package, i will test the package to prepare it for the finale.

Yes, i will use a VM instead of setting my PC on risk because why would i and incase malware

Yes, i will use virustotal

Yes, i will test it with an anti-virus (ms defender and 3rd party others)

**Yes, i do not know what i am doing**

**No, it is not garenteed that your package will be accepted**

**Yes,**

Yes, if your package is complicated i may need to ask for a guide

Yes, i will review the code dispite how **terrible i am**

Yes, I am getting *bored* of **writing this.**

this can usually take up to 5 days or something

## final
When i am finally done doing review, i will respond to the original pull request and say final verdict,

If Denied - your package does not get submitted, simple
If Accepted - your package will be put in the packages folder of the main repo for everybody to download

If you get accepted, congrats your now a anuome package developer
