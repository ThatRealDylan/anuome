Anuome is a random package manager (why do i keep making package managers) created by me thats (maybe) cool and has a gui if you hate command line stuff, this project is not open-source yet, but i plan to make it that in the future. anuome will be able to work on Windows and Linux, there are no plans for a macOS port. made in python (why) and a bunch of other stuff you probably don't want me to ramble about
